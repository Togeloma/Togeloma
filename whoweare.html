                <p>Hello, my name is Vincent and I am eager to be involved with the Rare Care program. With some background 
                  on research 
                  in malaria as one of my projects, I have developed a deep understanding and would be delighted to help patient care. 
                  Not only 
                  do I have some prior knowledge, but I believe that my abilities and skills are enhanced through my empathy and resilience. 
                  My experiences 
                  have taught me how important it is to resonate with patients, and I am passionate about being able to make a difference. 
                  Finally, 
                  I hope I can bring these qualities to RareCare and make a lasting impact.</p>

                  a

                  the
                  organization but also gained a better understanding of what we can do to help the cancer community

                <p>My name is Oscar Cao. I am currently a grade 10 student from Saint George’s School. My school is clear with its emphasis on values 
                  such as empathy 
                  and resilience, these values create the idea that the aim of education is to give back to the community. I see my participation in 
                  Rarecare to 
                  be a way to apply this very idea. The wide array of my courses at school and my co-curricular activities surrounds STEM, therefore I 
                  aim to 
                  contribute to Rarecare with a focus on both research and website building.</p>

                <p>I am a 10th grade student at Shawnigan Lake School. I want to join Rare Care because I know that 
                  kindness and 
                  compassion are increasingly rare in today's society. Across the African continent, 2.6 million 
                  children 
                  under the age of five die each year. And Rare diseases are widespread conditions that affect 
                  millions 
                  of people worldwide. For example, RD patients in Africa face enormous financial difficulties due 
                  to high 
                  medical costs and social marginalization. So I want to help them, even some small actions can make 
                  a big effect. 
                  So I want to spread even a little bit of kindness around the world.</p>
